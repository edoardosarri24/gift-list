\chapter{Introduction}
This document outlines the concept for a "Gift List" application, designed to streamline the process of gift-giving for various celebrations and events. The core idea is to provide a platform where a celebrant (e.g., a birthday person, a couple getting married) can curate and share a personalized wish list of gifts they would like to receive.

\myskip

The application serves two primary user roles:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The Celebrant \\
        This user creates and manages their gift list. They can add, remove, and describe desired items. Critically, the celebrant will not have visibility into the real-time status of their gift list regarding which items have been claimed. This maintains the element of surprise for them.
    \item The Guest \\
        Guests receive a link to the celebrant's gift list. They can browse the available items and, crucially, "claim" a gift they intend to purchase. Once a gift is claimed by one guest, it becomes visibly unavailable to all other guests. This mechanism prevents duplicate gifts and helps guests coordinate their purchases efficiently.
\end{itemize}

The primary goal of this application is to simplify gift coordination, reduce redundant gifts, and enhance the gift-giving experience by ensuring celebrants receive desired items while preserving the element of surprise.

\section{Requirements}
In this Section we will define the requirements for the application. The application must meet the following functional requirements:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Celebrant Management}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item User Authentication (Celebrant Only) \\
            The application must allow Celebrants to register and log-in to manage their lists securely. Guests should be able to access lists via a shared link without requiring an account, to minimize friction.
        \item List Management \\
            Authenticated Celebrants must be able to create and delete gift lists.
        \item Item Management \\
            Celebrants must be able to add, edit, and remove items from their lists. For each item, they can provide a name, description, an optional external URL, and set a preference level (e.g., Low, Medium, High).
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Guest Interaction}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item List Access \\
            Guests must be able to view a specific gift list using a unique URL provided by the Celebrant. To access the list items, a Guest must provide an email address; this is mandatory to ensure the system can notify the Guest if a claimed item is subsequently removed by the Celebrant.
        \item Item Claiming \\
            Guests must be able to mark an item as "claimed" or "purchased". This action must be visible to other Guests to prevent duplicate purchases but must remain hidden from the Celebrant to preserve the surprise.
        \item Item Unclaiming \\
            Guests must be able to revert a claim (e.g., in case of accidental selection), making the item available again. This action is only permitted for the guest who originally claimed the item.
        \item Personal Claim Visibility \\
            Guests accessing the list should clearly distinguish which items they have personally claimed versus those claimed by others, facilitating easier management of their intended purchases.
        \item Guest Claim Summary \\
            Guests must have access to a dedicated view or section that lists only the items they have personally claimed for a specific list, providing a clear summary of their planned gifts.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{System Integrity}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Claimed Item Removal \\
            If a Celebrant removes an item that has already been claimed by a Guest, the system must allow the removal but must immediately notify the Guest who claimed it. This prevents the Guest from purchasing an item that is no longer desired, while maintaining the Guest's anonymity.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Internationalization (i18n)}
The application is designed to be accessible to a global audience, with initial support for two languages:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{English}: The default language for the interface and system communications.
    \item \textbf{Italian}: Full support for the Italian language.
\end{itemize}
The application will detect the user's browser language setting to provide the most appropriate initial experience, while also allowing users to manually switch between supported languages via a language selector in the UI.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Accessibility}
The "Gift List" application will follow a phased release strategy regarding platform availability:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Initial Phase: Web Application \\
        The application will initially be accessible exclusively as a web application through modern web browsers. Official support will be focused on the most widely used browsers (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, and Microsoft Edge). Limiting official support to these "evergreen" browsers ensures a consistent user experience, optimal performance, and robust security by leveraging the latest web standards and security protocols.
    \item Future Phase: Mobile Applications \\
        Following the stabilization of the web platform, dedicated native or hybrid applications are planned for distribution through the Apple App Store and Google Play Store to provide a more integrated mobile experience.
\end{itemize}
